STOP & YIELD - Traffic Sign Detection & Recognition For Blind Pedestrian. </br>
Using OpenCV Java framework, I create Android app. </br>
I used Computer Vision concepts like, Color Thresholding, Contour/Shape Detection & Recognition, Filters for noise reduction etc.</br>
I used Google Computer Vision API for Character Recognition.</br>
Android app. take photo as input and present output by test and voice notification and if stop/yield traffic sign find it draw outline around traffic sign.
